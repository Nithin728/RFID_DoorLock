The following contains prototype circuits and arduino code for the
ESP-32. The test file contains individual tests to test individual 
functions and sensors. RFIDLockCodeRev is the complete arduino code. 
The most up to date version is RFIDLockRev5. These programs can be 
run in Arduino or PlatformIO. Arduino takes a long time to compile, but
platformIO can do it faster.
